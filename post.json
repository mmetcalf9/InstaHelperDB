		"comment": "Photo by @babaktafreshi / It was September 1999, 
				   in a beautiful mountain village in Iran's Alamut Valley, 
				   where I set the camera to capture the nine-hour night on 
				   a single frame of Ektachrome 100 slide film. The Earth's 
				   rotation did the rest of the job, creating star trails, 
				   with Polaris, the North Star, at the top right.
				   I confess I had a more personal motivation: There was an 
				   amazing girl in our travel group with the same passion as me 
				   for the night sky. We were working together at an Iranian 
				   astronomy magazine and had just started dating. The long 
				   exposure gave me the whole night to chat with her under these 
				   poplar trees and the starry sky. We married two years later.",

		"comment": "Photo by Karine Aigner @kaigner / In the depths of the Amazon, 
					in Ecuador's Yasuni National Park, there's a clay lick where parrots
					and macaws descend from the rainforest canopy to "drink." Parrots eat
					a variety of berries and toxic fruits; the minerals from the clay lick
					counteract the toxicity. On this day, we had been waiting for the 
					parrots to descend, a process that can take hours. The parrots had 
					almost come down twiceâ€”we had been there for thousands of minutes. 
					As the heat of the forest overtook us, we became dozyâ€¦and thatâ€™s when
					it happened. The area became silent, and there he stood in place of the
					birdsâ€”a full-grown, male jaguar. He investigated the small cave, smelled
					around the rocks, and stared at us quizzically from 100 feet away, as our
					mouths hung open in awe. Deliberately, and as quietly as heâ€™d come, he 
					continued into the forest, leaving us speechless. For more human wildlife
					stories follow @kaigner. #jaguar #amazon #bigcats #ecuadorwildlife
